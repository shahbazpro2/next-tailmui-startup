//       "We went to see a concert at Bolton Stadium and ordered a taxi from this firm. Of course the place was gridlocked when we came out but the driver was constantly in touch with us by phone and navigated us to a place where we could meet safely and away from the traffic. He then returned us to our guest house in Bury. Once there we discovered that my friend had left her phone in the taxi. They immediately phoned the driver to check and he had it. Phew! We just had to pick up at Bury Office in the morning. We went to office in the morning and unfortunately the phone hadn't been handed in. The lady on the phone/reception there, 'Julia' was absolutely brilliant. Locating the manager of the firm and the driver and also the safe return of my friends phone. Thank you Julia. Xx.",

They've never let me down, and the only problem I've ever had with them has been getting them to understand where I want picking up when I've been at the Rock. They have to pick me up opposite the little roundabout outside J D Sports, as I can't walk far. The driver(s) didn't seem to want to come down to the roundabout  (don't know why) and gave me the runaround after leaving me standing for 15 - 25 minutes  (this has happened 3 or 4 times now) Some of the drivers are a bit grumpy and sullen,  but most of them seem pleasant enough, and some are really nice - much like people in general,  I guess. Still,  the way I see it, if you're in a profession that deals with the public, it helps if you actually appear to like people...or at least make an effort to seem as if you do.",
